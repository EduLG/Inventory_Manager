Inventory Manager with Cloud Synchronization for SMEs

PRESENTATION

This project develops a desktop application for inventory management in small and medium-sized enterprises, using Java with Swing for the interface and Spring Boot for the backend. The solution aims to optimize stock control by allowing users to register products, manage incoming and outgoing inventory, and generate alerts when stock levels become critical. Additionally, the MySQL database ensures structured and secure storage. This software will facilitate inventory administration, reducing manual errors and improving operational efficiency.

General Objective:
Develop a desktop application for inventory management in small and medium-sized enterprises, using Java with Swing for the graphical interface and Spring Boot for the backend, to optimize stock control and enhance operational efficiency.

Specific Objectives:
Design an intuitive and functional graphical interface using Java Swing, allowing users to manage products, inventory entries and exits, and stock alerts easily.

Implement a robust backend with Spring Boot to handle business logic, database communication, and user authentication.

Configure a MySQL database to store product information, stock movements, and user data in a structured and secure manner.

Develop a product management module that allows adding, editing, deleting, and consulting products, including details such as name, quantity, price, and category.

Implement an alert system to notify users when a product's stock level falls below a critical threshold.



USED TECH

1. Programming Languages
Java:
Java is the language I have worked with the most throughout my education, and not only is it the one I have enjoyed the most (far more than Kotlin), but it also offers the best career opportunities. Additionally, its integration with Swing and Spring Boot makes it a solid choice for this project. It allows for the development of both the graphical interface (with Swing) and the backend (with Spring Boot), ensuring code consistency and efficiency.

2. Frameworks
Spring Boot:
Spring Boot simplifies backend development by providing integrated tools for dependency management, security, and database connectivity. Furthermore, it is a technology permitted by the project guidelines. It facilitates the creation of a robust and scalable backend, enabling business logic management, user authentication, and database communication.

Swing:
It is used to develop cross-platform graphical user interfaces in Java. I believe its learning curve is manageable for a project of this type. It allows for the creation of an intuitive and functional interface so that users can efficiently manage inventory.

3. Database
MySQL:
It is widely used in enterprise applications due to its performance, scalability, and ease of use, in addition to integrating seamlessly with Spring Boot.

4. Development Tools
IntelliJ IDEA:
It is the IDE I have worked with throughout my course, and I feel comfortable using it. It is a powerful tool that facilitates Java code writing, debugging, and management.

MySQL Workbench:
A tool for modeling and managing MySQL databases. It is the one I have used throughout my education, along with SQLite Studio for personal self-taught projects.

5. Version Control
Git:
It is the tool I will use for version control and tracking the project's evolution. It helps me organize and monitor the project's development.

6. Testing
JUnit:
A unit testing framework for Java, focused on ensuring code quality through automated tests.



Justification for Choosing the Topic
Why This Topic?
On a personal level, I am motivated by creating technological solutions that address real-world problems, such as optimizing processes in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Professionally, this project allows me to develop highly demanded IT industry skills, including database management, object-oriented programming, and graphical interface development.

Connection to the Job Market
This project aligns directly with the most valued skills in the IT sector. According to a LinkedIn report (2023), the most in-demand software development skills include:

Cross-platform application development (React, Java, Spring Boot).

Database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase).

Cybersecurity (authentication, data encryption).

Graphical interface development (Swing, JavaFX).

APIs and cloud services (Spring Boot, Firebase).

Additionally, Statista (2023) reports that the global inventory management software market is expected to grow by 8.5% annually until 2027, driven by SME digitalization. This means that the skills I develop in this project (inventory management, cloud synchronization, backend and frontend development) are directly applicable to an expanding industry.

Learning Objectives and Program Goals
This project enables me to apply and consolidate the knowledge acquired throughout my studies, from Databases and Programming to Interface Development and Data Access. It also helps me develop key transversal competencies such as:

Teamwork – Collaborating in the design and development of the project.

Problem-solving – Overcoming technical challenges like cloud synchronization or concurrency management.

Adaptability – Working with modern technologies aligned with market trends.

Inspiration and Future Vision
I was inspired to choose this topic after noticing how many SMEs still manage their inventories manually or with outdated tools. This project not only addresses a real problem but also positions me favorably in the job market. According to a Glassdoor study (2023), professionals with experience in software development and data management have 20% more job opportunities and earn 15% higher salaries than the industry average.

Conclusion
This project is not only relevant to my education but also prepares me to tackle the challenges of the job market. The skills I develop—database management, backend/frontend programming, and cybersecurity—are aligned with current IT industry trends and position me as a competitive and versatile professional. Furthermore, by addressing a real issue like inventory management, I contribute to the digitalization of SMEs, a key sector in the global economy.

All this information has been gathered from statistical industry websites, with the support of artificial intelligence to help me compile and organize it in a clear, structured, and concise manner.
